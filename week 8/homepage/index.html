    <h3 id="q1">💡 Why I Joined CS50?</h3>
    <p>
      I was looking for a good online course to build my fundamentals in coding.<br>
      I couldn't afford expensive courses and needed something flexible to manage with my BTech degree.<br>
      One day, I saw an Instagram reel about CS50 — and it was exactly what I was searching for!<br>
      Now here I am, enjoying the journey.
    </p>

    <h3 id="q2">📘 What I Have Learned So Far?</h3>
    <p>
      Honestly, I didn’t expect this much value packed into one course.<br>
      I had to pause and rethink the concepts multiple times, but it helped.<br>
      I'm now confident in programming with C and Python, though I still need more practice to master them.<br>
      Scratch was a fun experience, and the toughest part so far has been DSA in C and this week’s JavaScript.
